# Pushover Assest

If you want a nice icon for your Pushover app, feel free to use mine. Credit goes to [Creaticca Creative Agency](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/creaticca-creative-agency) on Flaticon for the initial design.

## Usage

Simply upload the image on [Pushover](https://pushover.net) within your app settings.

## Example

This is what it looks like:

## Label Template

If you want to add your own label to the Dash Button, feel free to use the template supplied. You just need to replace the background image layer with your own - as long as that layer is at the bottom, it should work just fine. This is a `.PSD` file so will require Photoshop.
